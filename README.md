Great! Here's a **GitHub-style `README.md`** file for your **Temperature Monitoring System in C**, following the exact format and tone of your inventory system example:

```markdown
# 🌡️ Industrial Temperature Monitoring System (TMS)

A C project that analyzes and monitors temperature data collected from sensors in an industrial manufacturing facility. It processes input from a CSV file, detects over-threshold values, and generates a report to help maintain optimal production conditions.

---

## 🛠 Features

- Reads temperature data from a `.csv` file
- Calculates key statistics:
  - 🔼 Maximum temperature
  - 🔽 Minimum temperature
  - 📊 Average temperature
- Detects temperatures above 95°F
- Logs over-threshold values into `over_threshold.csv`
- Displays temperature readings and analysis via console
- Demonstrates file handling and conditional data processing in C

---

## 📄 File Formats

### `temperature.csv`  
A simple text file where each line contains a temperature value in °F:
```

92.4
97.1
88.0
96.5

```

### `over_threshold.csv`  
Auto-generated file that lists temperatures exceeding the 95°F threshold.

---

## 🔢 Sample Output

```

Temperature 1: 92.40*F
Temperature 2: 97.10*F
Temperature 3: 88.00*F
Temperature 4: 96.50*F

\*\*\*\*\* DETAILS OF TEMPERATURE DATA \*\*\*\*\*
Average Temperature: 93.50*F
Max Temperature: 97.10*F
Min Temperature: 88.00*F
Temperatures over 95.0*F: 2

```

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the project in **Code::Blocks** or any C-compatible IDE
2. Place your `temperature.csv` file in the same directory as the executable
3. Build and run the project
4. Check the console for analysis and `over_threshold.csv` for alerts

---

## 📚 Concepts Demonstrated

- File I/O operations in C (`fopen`, `fscanf`, `fprintf`)
- Conditional and loop constructs
- Data aggregation (min, max, average)
- Threshold-based alerting
- Defensive programming and error checking

---

## 📦 Tools Used

- C (ISO Standard)
- Code::Blocks IDE
- Console Input/Output
